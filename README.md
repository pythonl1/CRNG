# CRNG
Custom Random Number Generator with Bias based on users input.

This module uses the default time library of python to generate psudo random numbers with user providing the upper and lower limits, bias percentage and total numbers to be generated.

Its pretty basic random number generator solely focused on the custom biasing of the result.
